## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-28

First tagged release of the hardened boilerplate.

### Added

- Pre-push hook (`.husky/pre-push`) runs `npm test -- --run` before every push.
- Conventional Commits enforcement via `@commitlint/cli` + `@commitlint/config-conventional`, configured in `commitlint.config.js`, wired through `.husky/commit-msg`.
- SAST/security linting via `eslint-plugin-security` (recommended preset; noisy `detect-object-injection` disabled).
- `npm run audit` / `npm run audit:ci` scripts for dependency vulnerability scanning.
- Web Vitals capture (`web-vitals` library) via `src/core/perf/reportWebVitals.ts` — console in dev, Sentry breadcrumbs in production.
- Bundle analysis: `rollup-plugin-visualizer` wired conditionally on `vite build --mode analyze` (`npm run build:analyze`).
- Per-chunk bundle-size budgets enforced by `scripts/check-bundle-size.mjs` (`npm run size:check`).
- Persisted-state encryption: `redux-persist-transform-encrypt` for the auth slice, keyed by `VITE_PERSIST_ENCRYPT_KEY`. Fail-closed if the key is unset.
- Application logger at `src/core/log/logger.ts` with `debug/info/warn/error` levels — console in dev, Sentry breadcrumbs in production, `error` calls also `captureException`.
- Typed feature-flags helper at `src/core/featureFlags/flags.ts` exposing build-time `VITE_ENABLE_*` flags as a single `flags` object.
- Dependabot config (`.github/dependabot.yml`) — weekly npm + GitHub Actions updates with sensible groupings.
- Security CI workflow (`.github/workflows/security.yml`) — `npm audit:ci` + TruffleHog secret scan on PRs, pushes to `main`, and weekly cron.
- Release workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) — on `v*.*.*` tag: build, package `dist/` as a tarball, create a GitHub Release with the matching `CHANGELOG.md` section.
- Production deploy workflow (`.github/workflows/production-deploy.yml`) — push to `production` branch builds with prod env vars, enforces bundle budgets, then runs a `deploy` job with commented-out blocks for S3+CloudFront, Netlify, Vercel, and GitHub Pages.
- `release:patch` / `release:minor` / `release:major` npm scripts with `preversion` (lint + tests + build) gate and `postversion` push.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` documenting branching strategy, branch naming, commit messages, daily workflow, PR flow, deployments, and the Semantic-Versioning-based release flow.
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` documenting environments, required secrets per host, wiring steps, promotion flow, verification, and rollback.
- `docs/OBSERVABILITY.md` documenting the tooling map, required Sentry alert rules, dashboards, and day-to-day team expectations.
- `.github/pull_request_template.md` with summary / type / test plan / risk / checklist.
- `.github/CODEOWNERS` with per-path required reviewers (placeholder team handles).
- Vitest coverage thresholds (`vitest.config.ts`): statements 80 / lines 80 / functions 60 / branches 50. `@` alias resolved for tests.
- Initial test examples covering a component (`ErrorDisplay`), a slice reducer (`auth.slice`), and a util (`featureFlags`).

### Changed

- Bumped major versions: `@sentry/react` 9 → 10, `vitest` / `@vitest/*` 3 → 4, `jsdom` 26 → 29, `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` 5 → 7, `eslint-plugin-react-refresh` 0.4 → 0.5, `globals` 16 → 17, `@types/node` 24 → 25.
- Modernized husky hooks to v9 format (dropped deprecated shebang + `husky.sh` source).
- `src/store/store.ts` refactored to use `PersistConfig<RootReducerState>` so the conditional encryption path doesn't break `persistReducer` inference.
- `package.json` version `0.0.0` → `0.1.0`.

### Removed

- `@sentry/tracing@7.x` — deprecated; tracing is bundled into `@sentry/react` v8+. Dead chunk reference removed from `vite.config.ts`.

### Security

- Auth tokens persisted to `localStorage` are now AES-encrypted at rest. Persistence is disabled outright when `VITE_PERSIST_ENCRYPT_KEY` is not configured (no plaintext fallback).
- Conventional Commit messages enforced on every commit, preventing PRs from landing with messages that can't be parsed by changelog/release tooling later.
